# Supervised Machine Learning

The following projects were created while exploring machine learning with Python at IBM courses. Each notebook contains a detailed description of creating and evaluating a model. The two types of models that are described in these notebooks are regression and classification.

## Regression

### Simple linear regression

This notebook provides:

* Description of creating a simple linear regression model to predict CO2 emissions of a car based on one feature
* Visualizing correlations between the variables
* Choosing an appropriate feature
* Modeling and evaluation

### Multiple linear regression

This notebook provides:

* Description of creating a simple linear regression model to predict CO2 emissions of a car based on several features
* Splitting the set into training and testing
* Ordinary least squares
* Modeling and evaluation

### Polynomial regression

This notebook deals with:

* What to do when the data trend is not quite linear
* Using polynomial features
* Working with different orders
* Modeling and evaluating

### Non-linear regression

This notebook shows:

* What to do when a linear model does not produce satisfactory results
* Difference between quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, and logistic regression
* Model building and evaluation
* Process of choosing best parameters

### Regression trees

This notebook provides:

* Explanation of regression trees
* The parameters of this regressor
* Modeling and evaluation
* Using different criteria

## Classification

### Decision Trees

This notebook shows:

* Explanation of the decision trees classification algorithm
* Data preparation
* Modeling and evaluation
* Results interpretation

### K-Nearest Neighbours

This notebook deals with:

* Explanation of the KNN algorithm
* Data preparation and normalization
* Training, testing and evaluating
* Experimenting with different numbers of **k**

### Logistic Regression

This notebook shows:

* Explanation of the difference between the linear and logistic regressions
* Data preparation
* Training, testing and evaluating using different metrics

### Multi-Class Classification

This notebook deals with:

* Explanation of the multi-class classification algorithm
* Data preparation and normalization
* Using Softmax Regression
* One-vs-all and one-vs-one classifications

### Support Vector Machine

This notebook provides:

* Explanation of the SVM algorithm
* Data pre-processing and selection
* Modeling and evaluating
