# Supervised_ML_IBM
This repository contains notebooks that I worked with and on while studying machine learning with Python at IBM courses. Each notebook contains a detailed description of creating and evaluating a model. The two types of models that are described in these notebooks are regression and classification.

## Simple linear regression

This notebook provides:

* Description of creating a simple linear regression model to predict CO2 emissions of a car based on one feature
* Visualizing correlations between the variables
* Choosing an appropriate feature
* Modeling and evaluation

## Multiple linear regression

This notebook provides:

* Description of creating a simple linear regression model to predict CO2 emissions of a car based on several features
* Splitting the set into training and testing
* Ordinary least squares
* Modeling and evaluation

## Polynomial regression

This notebook deals with:

* What to do when the data trend is not quite linear
* Using polynomial features
* Working with different orders
* Modeling and evaluating

## Non-linear regression

This notebook shows:

* What to do when a linear model does not produce satisfactory results
* Difference between quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, and logistic regression
* Model building and evaluation
* Process of choosing best parameters

## Regression trees

This notebook provides:

* Explanation of regression trees
* The parameters of this regressor
* Modeling and evaluation
* Using different criteria

## Data sets

* [Car set](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/data/FuelConsumptionCo2.csv) for simple, multiple and polynomial regressions
* [Chine GDP](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/data/china_gdp.csv) for non-linear regression
* [Houses](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/data/real_estate_data.csv) for regression tree.

All the notebooks are based on the learning material of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course material. The data sets are downloaded from the IBM server.
